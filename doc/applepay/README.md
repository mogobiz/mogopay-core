### Special notes
* In `/pay/submit` (step 4) make sure you specify these parameters:
  * `success_url`: This URL would be called in step 7, and its result would be passed to the iOS app with no additional treatment (step 8 & 9).
The usage you'd make of the result is up to you. In the sample app we simply print it in an alert box.
  * `gateway_data`: must contain the Apple Pay token (from `PKPayment`).

## Handling errors
There are 3 kinds of possible errors:

* Connexion to Authorize.net failed: will return a 500 code as well as a JSON object containing `NoResponseFromAuthorizeNetException` in the `type` field.  
* Authorize.net returned an error code: will return a 500 code as well as a JSON object containing `AuthorizeNetErrorException` in the `type` field and Authorize.net's code in the `error` field.  
* No success URL provided:  will return a 500 code as well as a JSON object containing `NoSuccessURLProvided` in the `type` field.
